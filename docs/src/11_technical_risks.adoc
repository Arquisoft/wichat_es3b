== Risks and Technical Debts

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]

| Risk | Relevance | Considerations
| Limited expertise in specific tools or programming languages | 2 | The team may encounter difficulties due to varying levels of familiarity with required tools and languages. To address this, we will prioritize the use of well-known technologies within the team while encouraging knowledge-sharing and individual learning efforts.
| Lack of prior collaboration within the team | 1 | Since the team has not worked together before, there is a risk of inefficiencies in coordination. Establishing clear communication channels and regularly updating each other on progress will mitigate this issue.
| Large team size | 1 | A higher number of contributors can complicate communication and workflow synchronization. Implementing structured meetings and documentation processes should help maintain efficiency.
| Potential delays in integrating external APIs | 2 | Depending on external data sources, such as Wikidata, might introduce latency or downtime risks. Developing fallback mechanisms and caching strategies can help mitigate disruptions.
| Knowledge disparity among team members | 2 | Some team members have prior experience, either from retaking the course or external knowledge, while others are learning these concepts for the first time. This can lead to uneven task distribution and communication gaps. Encouraging mentoring and pairing experienced members with those less familiar can help balance the workload and improve overall team efficiency.

=== Technical Debts

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Technical Debt | Considerations
| Game logic is handled on the frontend instead of the backend| Ideally, the game logic should reside on the backend to enhance security and maintainability. However, due to time constraints, it currently remains on the frontend. This introduces potential risks, as the logic can be easily bypassed or modified by users. Refactoring this component to the backend is planned for future iterations.
| Free MongoDB Atlas version| The free version of MongoDB Atlas has limitations on the number of connections and data storage. As the project scales, we may need to upgrade to a paid plan or consider alternative database solutions.
| The project is not fully e2e tested| The project lacks comprehensive end-to-end tests at some points as LLM interactions or API requests, which can lead to undetected issues in the user experience. We plan to implement e2e tests in future iterations to ensure a more robust application.
| Basic Graphana and Prometheus configuration| The current configuration of Graphana and Prometheus is basic, we must improve it to ensure effective monitoring and alerting. This includes setting up more detailed dashboards, alerts, and performance metrics to better understand the application's behavior and performance.
| Unable to update questions without restarting the server| Currently, updating questions requires redeploying the server. This is usefull now, when we are constantly updating and redeploying the aplications. But in the future, we should implement a more dynamic solution that allows for real-time updates to questions without requiring a server restart. This will improve the user experience.
