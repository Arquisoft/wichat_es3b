== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Introduction
WiChat is a game designed for an online experiment done by RTVE, with the typical TV quiz contest format. To implement this application, we need to call several external APIs. Wikidata is the one in charge of giving us the information we require for the questions and the answers, and also the images the user is going to see, which are the main part of the application. We also use an LLM for generating some hints for the user (in form of wildcards) and a database for storing the user log-in information.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

|===
|Communication Partners|Input|Output
|User|The user sees the web application in real time and makes decisions accordingly.|Performs actions on the application such as answering a question, using a wildcard or asking a question to a chatbot.
|Web Application|Receives user inputs and data from backend services.|Updates the interface to show to the user.
|Backend Service|Takes actions from users received from the web application and data returned by different APIs.|Manages calls to APIs and updates the view of the web application.
|Wikidata|Receives a query about a theme or category.|Returns a page corresponding to the given query.
|LLM|Gets relevant information about the question the user has to answer.|Interacts or answers the user in several ways, depending on the used wildcard.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

|Communication Partners|Explanation
|Web Application|The user can play the game using Internet, via HTTP.
|Backend Service|Manages data and user actions, chatting with LLMs and generates trivia questions through calls to the respective APIs.
|Database|MongoDB database for storing users information.
|Wikidata|Data is obtained throught SPARQL queries made by the service.
|LLM|Gets relevant information about the question the user has to answer.
