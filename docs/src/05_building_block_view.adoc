== Building Block View



=== Whitebox Overall System

image:5_Overview_diagram.png[]

Motivation::

This view describes the decomposition of the WIChat system into several building blocks, focusing on the web application, external API interactions, and data handling, in order to provide an interactive and efficient user experience.

Contained Building Blocks::

- **Webapp**: Manages the user interface and game logic.
- **User Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication by validating login credentials and issuing a JWT token upon successful verification.
- **User Stats Service**: Handles user stats about the games played.
- **User Service**: Handles user registration and manages API key generation and validation for secure access.
- **Question Service**: Generates and retrieves questions.
- **LLM Service**: Provides hints for users during the quiz.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests between the frontend and backend.
- **Database**: Stores user data and question-related metadata.

Important Interfaces::

- **User API**: Allows interaction with user data.
- **Question API**: Provides access to questions and answers.
- **Hint API**: Offers hints for the questions.

Both Question and Hint API will make use of external services (SONAR and Wikidata), and therefore will use their APIs.

| **Name** | **Responsibility** 
| Webapp |Main entry point for users. It renders the graphical interface and executes game logic in client.
| API Gateway |Central request router between the Webapp and backend services.
| Question Service | Generates and retrieves system questions, based on catrgory and difficulty level.
| User Authentication Service | Verifies login credentials and issues secure tokens for authenticated access.
| User Service | Registers new users and manages the lifecycle of API keys for client authorization.
| User Stats Service | Collects and updates user performance data from played games.
| Hint Generation Service | Generates hints for questions based on difficulty level, by means of a LLM.
| Database | Stores user information and questions. Recieves requests to store questions and manages credentials.

=== Level 2

==== WebApp
Composed of modules to handle the interface, game logic and API communication.
