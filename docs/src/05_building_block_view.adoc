=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

This view describes the decomposition of the WIChat system into several building blocks, focusing on the web application, external API interactions, and data handling, in order to provide an interactive and efficient user experience.

Contained Building Blocks::

- **Webapp**: Manages the user interface and game logic.
- **User Authentication Service**: Handles user registration and login.
- **Question Service**: Generates and retrieves questions.
- **Hint Generation Service**: Provides hints for users during the quiz.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests between the frontend and backend.
- **Database**: Stores user data and question-related metadata.

Important Interfaces::

- **User API**: Allows interaction with user data.
- **Question API**: Provides access to questions and answers.
- **Hint API**: Offers hints for the questions.

Both Question and Hint API will make use of external services (SONAR and Wikidata), and therefore will use their APIs.

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
|===

If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility** 
| Webapp |Main entry point for users. It renders the graphical interface and executes game logic in client.
| API Gateway |Central request router between the Webapp and backend services.
| Question Service | Generates and retrieves system questions, based on catrgory and difficulty level.
| User Authentication Service | Manages user registration, authentication and administration.
| Hint Generation Service | Generates hints for questions based on difficulty level, by means of a LLM.
| Database | Stores user information and questions. Recieves requests to store questions and manages credentials.
|===


=== Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== WebApp
Composed of modules to handle the interface, game logic and API communication.

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility** 
|UI Renderer|Renders interface elements.
|Game |Controls application logic rules.
|GameView |Controls the Game.
|API Client|Manages calls to backend services.

endif::arc42help[]

==== Question Service
Decomposed into modules for both managing questions and storing data.

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility** 
|Question Repository|Accesses and manipulates data in the database.
|Difficulty Manager|Adjusts questions based on difficulty.
|WikiData Fetcher|Queries WikiData for relevant information.

=== Level 3

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

|UserAuth Client|Manages user authentication
|Question Client|Retrieves questions from the backend.
|Hint Client|Requests hints from the corresponding service.
