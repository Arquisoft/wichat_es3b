== Runtime View


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Sign In
A user wants to create a new account. The user introduces the required information and clicks the "Sign In" button. The system validates the information and creates a new account. If all the process runs correctly, the system logs in the user and redirects to the main page.

=== New Question
A user wants to start a new round, it can be a new question or start a new game. The system generates a new question and shows it to the user. The user answers the question and the system validates the answer. The system updates the user's score and stats, then shows the results to the user.

=== New Clue
A user wants to get a new clue for the current question. The GameService cheks if all the conditions are met and asks the LLMService for a new clue. The LLMService validates the clue and returns it to the GameService, which sends it to the GatewayService and finally to the WebApp.

=== Check Record
A user wants to check the record of a game session. The system loads all records and the user selects one to see the details. The system loads the details of the record and shows them to the user.
