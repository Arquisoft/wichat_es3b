== Introduction and Goals
This project was created and developed by a development team composed of students from the Software Architecture course
at the School of Computer Engineering of the University of Oviedo.

Last year, the company HappySw launched a project aimed at updating an experimental online version of a quiz
competition similar to "Saber y Ganar" for the RTVE network.

This year, the company ChattySw wants to expand its functionality so that contestants can interact with the application by
receiving hints about the answers.

This is the development team:

* **Enol Rodríguez Hevia**: _UO287935_
* **Alberto Fernández Azcoaga**: _UO179637_
* **David González González**: _UO291047_
* **Zinedine Álvarez Sais**: _UO294258_
* **Alejandro Vega García**: _UO294615_
* **Ignacio Llaneza Aller**: _UO294914_
* **Daniel Uría Edroso**: _UO282813_

=== Requirements Overview
* The system will include at least a web frontend that will display images and answers, as well as a hint system
that will allow users to receive clues about the images.

* Users will be able to register in the system and consult the history of their participation in the system: number
of games, number of correct/failed questions, times, etc.

* The website must be deployed and accessible via the web.

* The question data will be automatically generated from Wikidata API.

* Users will be able to interact with the application for each question to obtain hints. This will be achieved through
a language model (LLM) accessed via a provided API.

* There will be a time limit to answer each question.

* The system will provide API access to user information, which must be properly documented.

* The system will also provide API access to the generated questions.

* Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect (distracting) answers. All answers will be genereated
automatically.

* A technique must be implemented to generate hints from Wikidata data while mitigating incorrect
answers and hallucinations during interactions.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Expectations
| _1_ | *_Usability_* | _All people should be able to enjoy and finish with success the application within a reasonable
limit of time_
| _2_ | *_Maintainability_* | _The application should be easy to maintain, with clear, well-documented code and modular
design that allows for future updates._
| _3_ | *_Accessibility_* | _The application should be usable by people with various disabilities, meeting common
accessibility standards_
| _4_ | *_Availability_* | _While the application initially aimed for a 99.9% availability target, this level of uptime 
typically requires production-grade infrastructure, including redundancy, autoscaling, and service-level agreements (SLAs) 
provided by cloud providers.
Since this project is hosted on Microsoft Azure using student credits, it does not benefit from guaranteed SLAs or high-availability 
configurations. Therefore, a more realistic expectation for availability is in the range of 99.0% to 99.5%, which allows for occasional 
downtime due to maintenance, restarts, or limited resource allocations in the free tier._
| _5_ | *_Reliability_* | _The application should operate consistently and recover quickly from failures_

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
