== Introduction and Goals
This project was created and developed by a development team composed of students from the Software Architecture course
at the School of Computer Engineering of the University of Oviedo.

Last year, the company HappySw launched a project aimed at updating an experimental online version of a quiz
competition similar to "Saber y Ganar" for the RTVE network.

This year, the company ChattySw wants to expand its functionality so that contestants can interact with the application by
receiving hints about the answers.

This is the development team:

* **Enol Rodríguez Hevia**: _UO287935_
* **Alberto Fernández Azcoaga**: _UO179637_
* **David González González**: _UO291047_
* **Zinedine Álvarez Sais**: _UO294258_
* **Alejandro Vega García**: _UO294615_
* **Ignacio Llaneza Aller**: _UO294914_
* **Daniel Uría Edroso**: _UO282813_

=== Requirements Overview
* The system will include at least a web frontend that will display images and answers, as well as a hint system
that will allow users to receive clues about the images.

* Users will be able to register in the system and consult the history of their participation in the system: number
of games, number of correct/failed questions, times, etc.

* The website must be deployed and accessible via the web.

* The question data will be automatically generated from Wikidata API.

* Users will be able to interact with the application for each question to obtain hints. This will be achieved through
a language model (LLM) accessed via a provided API.

* There will be a time limit to answer each question.

* The system will provide API access to user information, which must be properly documented.

* The system will also provide API access to the generated questions.

* Each question will have one correct answer and several incorrect (distracting) answers. All answers will be genereated
automatically.

* A technique must be implemented to generate hints from Wikidata data while mitigating incorrect
answers and hallucinations during interactions.

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Expectations
| _1_ | *_Usability_* | _All people should be able to enjoy and finish with success the application within a reasonable
limit of time_
| _2_ | *_Maintainability_* | _The application should be easy to maintain, with clear, well-documented code and modular
design that allows for future updates._
| _3_ | *_Accessibility_* | _The application should be usable by people with various disabilities, meeting common
accessibility standards_
| _4_ | *_Availability_* | _While the application initially aimed for a 99.9% availability target, this level of uptime 
typically requires production-grade infrastructure, including redundancy, autoscaling, and service-level agreements (SLAs) 
provided by cloud providers.
Since this project is hosted on Microsoft Azure using student credits, it does not benefit from guaranteed SLAs or high-availability 
configurations. Therefore, a more realistic expectation for availability is in the range of 99.0% to 99.5%, which allows for occasional 
downtime due to maintenance, restarts, or limited resource allocations in the free tier._
| _5_ | *_Reliability_* | _The application should operate consistently and recover quickly from failures_

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| _Teachers_ | _Jose Emilio Labra, Pablo González, Irene Cid, Diego Martín_ | The teachers are the supervisors of the
team and will help the team and should be accessible if the team needs them.
| _Students_ | _Enol Rodríguez, Alberto Fernández, David González, Zinedine Álvarez, Alejandro Vega
Ignacio Llaneza, Daniel Uría_ | _They are the development team. They should develop the application with success and
learn through the process of the subject_
| _Users_ | _Anyone who interacts with the application_ | They should be able to use the application without any
problems and enjoy the experience.
| _RTVE_ | _RTVE_ | They are the primary stakeholders in the application, as they commissioned it to allow their
viewers to use it.
