== Quality Requirements
In order to make Wichat a satisfactory final product, we find it crucial to set some quality requirements to live up with. These aspects are to influence architectural decisions and hence include some measurable features:

- **Usability:** Intuitive and easy interfaces, reducing the volume of help needed in order to use the application.
- **Mantainability:** Long-term enhancement support requiring minimal effort.
- **Accesibility:** Make the application usable to people with diverse disabilities.
- **Reliability:** Contistency and easy recovering.
- **Availability:** Handling increased traffic without compromising performance.


Moreover, some other non-functional requirements, while less prioritary, are still relevant:

- **Performance:** A smooth user experience, ensuring responsiveness and minimal delays.
- **Security:** Basic measures, even if sensitive data is not handled.
- **Compatibility:** Accesibility across diferent devices and screen sizes.
