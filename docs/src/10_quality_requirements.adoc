== Quality Requirements
In order to make Wichat a satisfactory final product, we find it crucial to set some quality requirements to live up with. These aspects are to influence architectural decisions and hence include some measurable features:

- **Usability:** Intuitive and easy interfaces, reducing the volume of help needed in order to use the application.
- **Mantainability:** Long-term enhancement support requiring minimal effort.
- **Accesibility:** Make the application usable to people with diverse disabilities.
- **Reliability:** Contistency and easy recovering.
- **Availability:** Handling increased traffic without compromising performance.


Moreover, some other non-functional requirements, while less prioritary, are still relevant:

- **Performance:** A smooth user experience, ensuring responsiveness and minimal delays.
- **Security:** Basic measures, even if sensitive data is not handled.
- **Compatibility:** Accesibility across diferent devices and screen sizes. 

=== Quality Tree

.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios
[cols="3,3,5,2"]
|===
|**ID** | **QA** | **Scenario** | **Priority**
| Q1.1 | Usability | The system must allow a player to start and quit a game without external help, within 3 minutes of opening the app, thanks to clear and simple interfaces. | High
| Q1.2 | Usability | Users must be able to navigate between different game sections (settings, chat, etc.) in no more than 2 taps. It should take under 10 seconds for an average user. | High
| Q2.1 | Mantainability | The addition of new questions must be quick and simple without interrupting the application flow. It should take approximately 5 minutes, this entailing no downtime for the application. | High
| Q2.2 | Mantainability | The system must allow the implementation of new game models with minimal changes to the existing codebase, which should not take more than 1 hour. There should not be any regression in existing game functionality. | Low
| Q3.1 | Accessibility | The application must support screen readers for users with visual impairments, guaranteeing as well buttons and answers that are simple to read. All interactive elements must have alternative text, and the screen reader should process the entire game in under 30 seconds for each screen. | High
| Q3.2 | Accessibility | An option for high-contrast mode for users with daltonism or another visual disability must be provided. The color contrast between text and background must have a contrast radio of at least 4.5:1 | High
| Q4.1 | Reliability | If the system fails during a game, it should allow the user to resume the game from the last saved state. No more than 1 minute of progess should be lost. | Medium
| Q5.1 | Availability | The system must mantain 99.9% uptime over a month, including the peak usage period. Downtime must not overcome 45 minutes/month. | High
| P1.1 | Performance | The product must respond to a player's request in less than 0.5s. | High
| P1.2 | Performance | The application should give support to approximately 100 simultaneous request without significant downgrade in performance | Medium
| S1.1 | Security | It must be ensured that player personal data (especially credentials) is encrypted, even if no sensitive data is handled. 0 data breaches must be admitted | Medium
| S1.2 | Security | The system must log all user actions related to account creation and gameplay. Unauthorized attempts to read private account information should trigger an alarm within 5 minutes | Low
| C1.1 | Compatibility | The game should work correctly on both mobile and desktop devices, adjusting the dessign for different screen sizes, at least between 4"-27". | Medium
| C1.2 | Compatibility | The system must support the latest versions of popular browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.). It should be completely functional, with 0 visual/functional issues. | Medium

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
