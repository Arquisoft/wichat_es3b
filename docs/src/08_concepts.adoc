=== Service-oriented architecture

We have decided that our architecture will be based on microservices,but as the services are not fully decoupled at the data level it's more accurate a service-oriented architecture, which means that every part of the aplication will be divided in a service that performs a specific function. The services can communicate witch eachother using their repective APIs or via the shared database.



=== Build, Test, Deploy

The project follows a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and working correctly.
Deployment is done manually to Azure. Each service is deployed in a container, and the frontend is exposed via a public IP.

=== Usability

Usability is crucial for any application, as it directly impacts user interaction efficiency. To ensure our appâ€™s usability, we conducted extensive user research, leading to an intuitive interface design. Employing a user-centric approach throughout development, we prioritized user experience, facilitating easy navigation.

=== Internationalization
We have implemented internationalization (i18n) for both English and Spanish, covering the user interface as well as the question content.
