=== Service-oriented architecture

We have decided that our architecture will be based on microservices,but as the services are not fully decoupled at the data level it's more accurate a service-oriented architecture, which means that every part of the aplication will be divided in a service that performs a specific function. The services can communicate witch eachother using their repective APIs or via the shared database.



=== Build, Test, Deploy

The project follows a CI/CD pipeline that automates build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and functioning correctly.

We have performed both coverage testing to ensure that key parts of the application logic are tested, and load testing to verify performance under heavy use. These tests help ensure a stable and reliable system.

Deployment is handled in two environments: locally using Docker containers for development and testing purposes, and in the cloud via Microsoft Azure for production deployment. Each service runs in a container, and the frontend is exposed through a public IP address.

=== Usability

Usability is crucial for any application, as it directly impacts user interaction efficiency. To ensure our appâ€™s usability, we conducted extensive user research, leading to an intuitive interface design. Employing a user-centric approach throughout development, we prioritized user experience, facilitating easy navigation.

=== Internationalization
We have implemented internationalization (i18n) to support both English and Spanish.
This includes not only the user interface but also the question content, ensuring that the entire experience is localized based on the user's language preference.
