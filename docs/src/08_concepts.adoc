== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

==== _Domain description_
|===
|Term |Description

|User
|Represents a user of the application.

|UserRecord
|Stores all the game sessions in which a user has participated and keeps their total score.

|GameSession
|Represents a game session played by a user, storing all the questions, the choices made, and the total score.

|Question
|Represents questions shown to the user by the application and stores the wrong choices, correct choices, and the text that is displayed.

|Choice
|Represents the choices that the user can make when answering a question. It stores the text of the choice and indicates if it was selected by the user.

=== _Microservices architecture_

_We have decided that our architecture will be based on microservices, which means that every part of the aplication will be divided in a service that performs a specific function. The services can communicate witch eachother using their repective APIs or via the shared database_



=== _Build, Test, Deploy_

_The project follows a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and working correctly._


=== _Usability_

_Usability is crucial for any application, as it directly impacts user interaction efficiency. To ensure our appâ€™s usability, we conducted extensive user research, leading to an intuitive interface design. Employing a user-centric approach throughout development, we prioritized user experience, facilitating easy navigation_
