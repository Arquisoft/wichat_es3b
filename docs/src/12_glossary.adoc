|A suggestion or help provided by the LLM to assist the user in answering a question. It is generated in response to a prompt created by us, using the information from the saved question.

|Unit Tests
|Unit tests are used to test individual components of your code in isolation. They are typically small and fast, allowing you to run them frequently during development.

|Code Coverage
|Code coverage is a measure of how much of your code is executed during tests. It helps identify untested parts of your code and can be used to improve test quality.

|Security Hotspots
|Security hotspots are areas of your code that may be vulnerable to security issues. They are typically identified by static analysis tools and should be reviewed carefully.

|E2E Tests
|End-to-end tests are used to test the entire application from start to finish. They simulate real user interactions and verify that the application behaves as expected.

|Load tests
|Load tests are used to test the performance of your application under heavy load. They simulate multiple users interacting with the application simultaneously and measure response times and resource usage.
