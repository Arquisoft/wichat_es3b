.Content
The deployment view describes:

1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::

The diagram above represents the initial version of our architecture, outlining the separation between its components. Our design follows a client-server model, where the server communicates with Wikidata to retrieve questions. This clear distinction between the frontend (client) and backend (server) ensures modularity, allowing different implementations to remain interchangeable as long as they adhere to the common API.

We utilize an Ubuntu server hosted on Azure, providing an isolated and pre-configured environment optimized for running our services. Hosting on Azure helps reduce infrastructure costs by reducing concerns such as security, availability, and maintenance.

We use Docker because it helps package our application and its dependencies into a standardized unit, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments, regardless of the machine's setup. Instead of using a monolithic architecture, we’ve chosen a microservices approach with Docker containers. This allows each service to be isolated, with its own resources, preventing conflicts and improving scalability and resilience. Each service has its own Docker image, which gives us flexibility in development and deployment. Our project includes services like the web application, gateway, user authentication, and MongoDB server. This Docker-based setup makes deployment, management, and resource use more efficient, while boosting flexibility and scalability.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Our Docker-based microservices architecture enhances both quality and performance by ensuring each service runs independently in its own container, optimizing resource allocation and preventing conflicts. This setup improves scalability, allowing services to scale as needed without affecting others. Additionally, it streamlines deployment and maintenance, reducing downtime and ensuring a consistent, high-performing system across different environments.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
The web app, gateway, and services run within Docker containers, all hosted on a server. The server manages these containers and communicates with Wikidata to retrieve questions. The gateway connects the web app with the services, while the services handle user data and generate questions.
