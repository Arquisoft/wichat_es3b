== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

Motivation::
The system is deployed on a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure. This choice ensures high availability, simplified scaling, and seamless integration with Azure services, meeting the performance, maintainability, and security requirements of the application.

Quality and/or Performance Features::
* **Portability:** Docker containers ensure consistent execution across various environments.
* **Maintainability:** Isolation of services enables independent updates and minimizes downtime.
* **Security:** Azure provides robust security features and network isolation, protecting both data and services.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
The deployment maps the following building blocks:
* **User Interface:** Delivered via a web application hosted on an Azure virtual machine.
* **Services:** Packaged as Docker containers within the Azure VM, each responsible for distinct functionalities (e.g., user management or question generation).
* **Persistence Layer:** A dedicated container hosting the database, accessible only to internal services.
* **External Services:** Secure connections are established to external APIs (e.g., Wikidata) to fetch dynamic content.

Below is a diagram summarizing the infrastructure distribution:

=== Infrastructure Level 2

This section provides a detailed view of selected infrastructure elements from Level 1.

==== Azure Virtual Machine Hosting the Web Application

This element represents the Azure virtual machine that hosts the web application. The VM runs a supported operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and includes the Docker engine to manage containerized services.

_Explanation_:
The Azure VM was selected for its reliability and integrated security features. Hosting the web application in a Docker container on Azure facilitates quick scaling and streamlined management while leveraging Azureâ€™s global network infrastructure.

==== Docker Container Environment

Within the Azure VM, the Docker engine orchestrates several containers, each encapsulating a service. This environment supports modular development and independent scalability.

_Explanation_:
The Docker container environment isolates each service, enabling independent updates and robust fault tolerance. Internal communication is handled through the Docker network, ensuring efficient and secure interactions between services.

| **Building Block** | **Infrastructure Mapping**

| Web Application (UI)
| Runs in the Web Application Container on the Azure VM, accessible to users via HTTP.

| API Service
| Runs in an exposed Docker container. Requires an API key for doing requests, ensuring secure communication with the web application.

| Services (authservice, userservice, statsservice, llmservice, wikiquestionservice)
| Each service is packaged in its own Docker container within the Docker Engine on the Azure VM, communicating over an isolated internal network.

| Gateway Service
| Acts as a single entry point for client requests. Deployed in its own Docker container, it routes traffic to internal services.

| Persistence(mongodb)
| Deployed as a dedicated container, ensuring secure data storage and access limited to internal services.

| Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
| Deployed as separate containers. Prometheus collects metrics from services; Grafana provides dashboards for visualization and analysis. Both are accessible internally for observability.
