== Deployment View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

endif::arc42help[]

Motivation::
The system is deployed on a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure. This choice ensures high availability, simplified scaling, and seamless integration with Azure services, meeting the performance, maintainability, and security requirements of the application.

Quality and/or Performance Features::
* **Scalability:** The containerized microservices architecture allows for scaling individual components based on demand.
* **Portability:** Docker containers ensure consistent execution across various environments.
* **Maintainability:** Isolation of services enables independent updates and minimizes downtime.
* **Security:** Azure provides robust security features and network isolation, protecting both data and services.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
The deployment maps the following building blocks:
* **User Interface:** Delivered via a web application hosted on an Azure virtual machine.
* **Microservices:** Packaged as Docker containers within the Azure VM, each responsible for distinct functionalities (e.g., user management or question generation).
* **Persistence Layer:** A dedicated container hosting the database, accessible only to internal services.
* **External Services:** Secure connections are established to external APIs (e.g., Wikidata) to fetch dynamic content.

Below is a diagram summarizing the infrastructure distribution:

=== Infrastructure Level 2

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.

endif::arc42help[]

This section provides a detailed view of selected infrastructure elements from Level 1.

==== Azure Virtual Machine Hosting the Web Application

This element represents the Azure virtual machine that hosts the web application. The VM runs a supported operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and includes the Docker engine to manage containerized services.

[plantuml, diagram2, svg]
----
@startuml
node "Azure VM" as AzureVM {
  package "Operating System" {
    node "Docker Engine" as Docker {
      component "Web Application Container" as WebApp
    }
  }
}
AzureVM --> "Azure Networking" : Internet Connectivity
@enduml
----

_Explanation_:
The Azure VM was selected for its reliability and integrated security features. Hosting the web application in a Docker container on Azure facilitates quick scaling and streamlined management while leveraging Azureâ€™s global network infrastructure.

==== Docker Container Environment

Within the Azure VM, the Docker engine orchestrates several containers, each encapsulating a microservice. This environment supports modular development and independent scalability.

[plantuml, diagram3, svg]
----
@startuml
node "Docker" {
  node "Container" as dc1 {
  component "User Service" as UserService
  }
  node "Container" as dc2 {
  component "Question Service" as QuestionService
  }
  node "Container" as dc3 {
  component "LLM Service" as LLMService
  }
  node "Container" as dc4 {
  component "Persistence DB" as Persistence
  }
}

UserService --> Persistence : User data management
QuestionService --> Persistence : Save/Get questions
@enduml
----

_Explanation_:
The Docker container environment isolates each microservice, enabling independent updates and robust fault tolerance. Internal communication is handled through the Docker network, ensuring efficient and secure interactions between services.

| **Building Block** | **Infrastructure Mapping**

| Web Application (UI)
| Runs in the Web Application Container on the Azure VM, accessible to users via HTTP/HTTPS.

| Microservices (User Service, Question Service, LLM Service)
| Each microservice is packaged in its own Docker container within the Docker Engine on the Azure VM, communicating over an isolated internal network.

| Persistence (Database)
| Deployed as a dedicated container, ensuring secure data storage and access limited to internal services.

| External API (Wikidata)
| Accessed securely over the public internet by relevant microservices.
